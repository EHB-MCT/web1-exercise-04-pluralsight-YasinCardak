			<h1>Pluralsight Skills</h1>
			<h2>Where teams build better technology skills, faster</h2>
			<p>
				Technology teams are only as successful as their skills are relevant.
				Give them access to Pluralsight Skillsâ€”courses, assessments, learning
				paths, and labs and you give them the tech fluency they need to build
				business-critical skills.
